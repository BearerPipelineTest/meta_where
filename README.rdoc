=MetaWhere

This is a complete rewrite of the previous version of MetaWhere. It's Rails 3.1-only
for now.

It's not really suitable for actual use yet, but you're welcome to test it and send
me feedback.

==What's new?

A lot.

* Symbol and hash methods aren't loaded by default. To enable them, do this in
  your MetaWhere.configure block: <tt>config.load_core_extensions!</tt>
* Speaking of, you can call MetaWhere.configure do |config| \[...\] end and do
  another bit of configuration, setting up your own aliases.
  <tt>config.alias_predicate :new_name, :old_name</tt>
* The preferred way to use the various enhancements is now by passing a block to
  the relation method you're calling. For example:

    Person.select{max(id).as(max_id)} # Call SQL functions
    Person.where{(name == 'bob') & (salary == 100000)} # Compounds & and | work

* Operators have changed. As before, operators starting with ! are only available
  on Ruby 1.9. Upgrade, for the love of all that is good and holy.

  * == - Equality
  * != - Inequality
  * ^ - Inequality, for those poor souls on 1.8.x
  * >> - In, (mnemonic: value >> [1,2,3], the value is running INTO the array)
  * << - Not in, (mnemonic: value << [1,2,3], the value is running OUT of the array)
  * =~ - Matches (SQL LIKE)
  * !~ - Not matches (SQL NOT LIKE) Again, only in Ruby 1.9
  * > - Greater than
  * >= - Greater than or equal to
  * < - Less than
  * <= - Less than or equal to
  * [] - Alternative function syntax. Just use parentheses, not sure I'm gonna keep [].
