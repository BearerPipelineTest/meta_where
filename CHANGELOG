Changes since 0.5.2 (2010-07-09):
  * Removed autojoin. Inner joins have side-effects. Newbies are the ones who aremost
    likely to use autojoin, and they're also the ones least likely to understand why
    certain rows stop being returned. Better to force a small learning curve. I've
    decided against leaving it in with deprecation since Rails 3 isn't final yet.
    Decided to get it out before it's "too late" to do so without impacting code running
    on a stable version of Rails.
  * Refactored build_arel to more closely mirror the refactoring that's been going on
    to the method in Rails edge.
  * Improved merge functonality. It shouldn't have ever required someone to do an
    autojoin to begin with. Now it just works. If you're merging two relations, you
    should expect to only get results that have a match on both sides.

Changes since 0.5.1 (2010-06-22):
  * Added debug_sql method to Relations. Lets you see the actual SQL that
    will be run against the database without having to resort to the
    development.log. Differs from to_sql because that doesn't (and can't,
    by necessity) handle eager loading.

Changes since 0.5.0 (2010-06-08):
  * Track Emilio Tagua's performance enhancements in build_arel from edge.

Changes since 0.3.3 (2010-04-30):
  * Lots. See http://metautonomo.us/2010/06/08/metasearch-and-metawhere-0-5-0-released/
    for a summary.
