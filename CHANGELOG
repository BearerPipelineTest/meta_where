Changes since 0.5.1 (2010-06-22):
  * Added debug_sql method to Relations. Lets you see the actual SQL that
    will be run against the database without having to resort to the
    development.log. Differs from to_sql because that doesn't (and can't,
    by necessity) handle eager loading.

Changes since 0.5.0 (2010-06-08):
  * Track Emilio Tagua's performance enhancements in build_arel from edge.

Changes since 0.3.3 (2010-04-30):
  * Lots. See http://metautonomo.us/2010/06/08/metasearch-and-metawhere-0-5-0-released/
    for a summary.
